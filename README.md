Our project
-----------
The [Workflow4Metabolomics](http://workflow4metabolomics.org), W4M in short, is a French infrastructure offering software tool processing, analyzing and annotating metabolomics data. It is based on the Galaxy platform.


Metabolites Correlation Analysis
--------------------------------
This tool takes as inputs, tabular table files from the metabolomic workflow.(variableMetadata,dataMatrix and SampleMetadata) and executes two possible functions ("sorting" and "corrdel").

The second option takes as input a table of your own and execute the "corr_matrix" function.

The first function "sorting":

1- It sorts the dataframe by rtmed column.
2- It computes the mean operation of all the signal values of the metabolites by sample, and put the results in a new column "signal_moy".
3- It finally creates a tabular output "sorted_table.tsv".
    
The second function "corrdel" for each pcgroup of the previous sorted tabular file "sorted_table.tsv", does the following things:

1- The first metabolite which has the highest value of mean signal intensity is selected.
2- Computes a global correlation matrix. 
3- Select the metabolites which are not correlated to others from the same pcgroup based on a threshold value "Correlation threshold".
4- It creates two tabular files: "correlation_matrix.tsv" (correlation matrix of all the metabolites) and "selected_metabolites_transpo.tsv" (metabolites tagged as deleted are removed and the dataframe is transposed)

The "corr_matrix" function computes a correlation matrix named "correlation_matrix.tsv" and creates a sif file named "sif_table.tsv" (for visualization in CytoScape).v


Galaxy
